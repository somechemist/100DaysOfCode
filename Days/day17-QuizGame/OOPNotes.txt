A Class is a blueprint for creating an eventual object

to create a class:

class User:
    pass

even empty, a class can create an object.

Class names should use PascalCase
Outside of classes, you will use snake_case for nearly everything else

Even empty, you can assign attributes

my_user = User()
my_user.id = "001"
my_user.username = "bob"

--------------------------

A constructor allows us to specify what should happen when an object is being constructed (Initialize)

We use a special function called init
    normally used to initialize the attributes
    Init will be called everytime you create a new object from this class
    self is the actual object being initialized.
    other parameters will be the other attributes

Class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.followers = 0

my_user = User("Bob") # So now self.name will be Bob, they will have a follower count of zero since that was set in the
                        constructor

Methods are the things that an object can do.

class car:
    def __init__(self)
        self.seats = 5

    def race_mode(self): (Methods always need a self parameter
        self.seats = 2

Class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.followers = 0
        self.following = 0

    def follow(self, user):
        user.followers += 1
        self.following += 1

user_1 = User("bob")
user_2 = User("chuck")

user_1.follow(user_2)
