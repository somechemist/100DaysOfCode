Always start by describing your problem. The more you know, the more you can ask ;)

Next you want to reproduce the bug you actually encounter.

Try to think like the computer. Remember it CAN ONLY do what you tell it to do.

Look for the errors in your ide if applicable. The debugging muscle will grow with practice.
Try debugging code questions you see on SE or discord

tools like pythontutor.com can be useful to visualize issues while stepping through your code

Never be afraid to walk away and think it over. When you aren't hyper focused, you can happen upon solutions to a problem that can be tested.

run your code often to test as you go

tackle bugs one at a time

If all else fails, you can check stack overflow.
