# Dictionaries, list, nesting one in another or two of the same or whatever

# Dictionaries in python have a key and a value that is associated to that key

# {key: value, key2: value2} is a dictionary.

# to add to dictionary:
#dictionary_1["key3"] = "Value3"

#Initialize or clear
#dictionary_2 = {}

#edit
#dictionary_1["key3"] = "value4"

#Looping it
#for key in dictionary_1:
#   print(key) # its the key
#   print(dictionary_1[key]) # its the value
